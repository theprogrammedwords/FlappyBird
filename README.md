# FlappyBird

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The
objective is to direct a flying bird which moves continuously to the right, between
sets of pipes.

**Constraints :**
1. If the player touches the pipe, they lose.
2. The bird briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the
screen is not tapped, bird falls of because of gravity.
3. Each pair of pipes that the bird navigates between earns the player a single
point.
4. If the bird exceeds the screen margins, the game overs.
